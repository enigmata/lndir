# lndir -- link Directory Tree

Create a shadow directory of symbolic links to another directory tree.

## Origin Story

Inspired by the X Window System utility of the same name. As such,
if one wanted to use this utility, on linux, they had to install
an X Window System package; for example, the
[`xutils-dev`](https://packages.ubuntu.com/artful/amd64/xutils-dev/filelist)
Ubuntu package.

Primilarly driven by the desire to learn the
[`std::filesystem`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem)
library, of [C++17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B17), I
was also motivated by the dream to one day make this utility
more accessible to people not using X Windows, or not interested
in installing such a package as `xutils-dev` in order to get
this single utility
